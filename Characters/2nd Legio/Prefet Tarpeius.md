Ancestery: Orc
Real name: Dorgarag
Legio name: Numerius Tarpeius Lento (BÃ¢che plus lente)

Joined the 2nd legio at 12 year old in 133. He was arrested in [[Silgean]] after a terrific tavern brawl that resulted in huge beating of local nobility and merchants. He was arrested and put in jail for 1 year (132-133) and was place in the care of [[General Curtius]] in 133 due to his strength and constitution ability who saw a waste of potential if he would have remained in jail.
