Real name: ?
Legio name: Proculus Curtius Salvius (Le proculus est plus court et plus s√ªr)

Enigmatic character that has no known background and join the 2nd Legio in 125. 
He made his renown by helping the Border Enforcement Unit when he was still training in [[Two Woods]] garrison as a recruit. Since no one knows, even himself, his birthday, many chose that day as his rebirth and celebrate his birthday on this day (September 11th 125).
He is currently seen from his soldiers as their true Father and many soldier joke about that he might be a descendant of the First King
