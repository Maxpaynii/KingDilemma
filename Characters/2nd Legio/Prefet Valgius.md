He was a known thief in the suburb of [[Lybra]] during all his youth and early adulthood. After a huge heist, he celebrated it through the night. The next morning he was found dead drunk in a stack of manure and was thrown in prison. A couple of weeks go by and he was bought as a slave by the former noble he stole from. He endured it during 15 year and bought his freedom, but the price was to enrolled himself for the 2nd Legio. He joined at the same time of [[General Curtius]] and was his right hand ever since.
