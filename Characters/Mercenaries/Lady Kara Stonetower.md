Lady Kara Stonetower is a towering warrior known for her enormous size and strength. Adopted by [[General Curtius]], she has trained extensively with elite army regiments. Her slow yet powerful blows are difficult to parry, making her a fearsome opponent on the battlefield. Lady Kara wields her heavy morning star named "Boulder," and when necessary, she utilizes her trusty dagger, "Lady's Smile," for swift and deadly attacks.
