Continent: [[Lywik]]
Capital : [[Aniar]]

Ankist shares a border with Mhuir to the northwest. The two kingdoms used to be almost comparable in size a few decades back, but Mhuir is now much smaller after they lost a war against Ankist in the year 143. Still, it is culturally and technologically more advanced.
