#Capital of the Kingdom of [[Cidlada]]
In the North of the [[Klamas Gulf]] and the [[Gaunt Isthmus]]

The small and poor kingdom of [[Cidlada]], to the south of Ankist, does not really have much to offer. Despite being completely harmless, it has not yet been conquered by any of its neighbours only because its stingy lands are even more onerous to administer than they would be easy to conquer.
