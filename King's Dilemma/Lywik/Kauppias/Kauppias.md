#Capital of the Republic of [[Kauppias]]

The Republic of Kauppias, despite ruling over the cold and rocky territories located to the northeast of the Kingdom of Ankist, has commercial abilities beyond imagination that more than compensate for the harshness of their homeland. Their leader, the [[Doge]], is elected every five years among the most talented merchants, and despite having only limited powers, they are the head of their army of mercenaries and, most importantly, they can veto the decisions of the [[Bank of Cards]], one of the most influential banks in the whole world.
