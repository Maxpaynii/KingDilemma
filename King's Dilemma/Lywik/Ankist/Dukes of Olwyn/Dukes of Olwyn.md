"What we do echoes in eternity"
The mild climate as well as the safe and favorable geographic position of the Duchy of Olwyn enabled its rapid economic and cultural development. Your family has always pushed for strong investments in technological research and alchemy. Despite having excellent carpenters and your fair share of coastline, you don't have a strong tradition of shipbuilding. Your people do not like to leave home, but they constantly try to make their houses more welcoming and safe. Your region has produced many famed scholars, and their knowledge has been applied most of all to agriculture and medicine. Among the great inventions your people produced are some of the most innovative treatments for human and animal diseases, fertilizers, and pesticides. Meanwhile, your great architectural works, such as very efficient mills, sturdy embankments, and irrigation canals have transformed your territory into an enormous barn that feeds most of the kingdom. The wealth and well-being spread across all social classes thanks to your architectural and alchemic advancements have predisposed your family and your people to accept novelty and whatever seems to bend the laws of nature as potential resources for improving society. You firmly believe poverty, famine, and all disease can be eradicated from the kingdom through ingenuity and knowledge.
