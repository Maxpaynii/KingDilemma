"Work is life"
Formerly an independent kingdom, the Duchy of Gamam was annexed by Ankist in the year 130, after the army of that kingdom surrounded the capital city of Golden Harbor. Also known as the people of the lobster, you are skilled tradesmen and hard workers. You are constantly busy people, and you spend a lot of time complaining that you have no time to enjoy the fruits of your labor and your generous land. You are haunted by the fact that life is too short. The people of Gamam developed a special sensitivity to luxury and beautiful things. You are proud of your efficiency and wealth, and you often complain that you pay too much in taxes. You feel that your relationship with the central government of the kingdom is one-way: you give a lot to the Crown, without receiving anything back but more taxes. From the outside, you are seen as demanding, arrogant, and fussy, but also elegant and sophisticated. Your capital city is clean and safe. All your people, including you and your family, complain that life ends too soon. You would give anything to have more time to enjoy the wealth you accumulate during your hard-working life.
