"Feel our sting"
Before becoming part of the kingdom of Ankist, the former kingdom of Dualak promptly turned down the many alliance proposals sent by the King of the Balance. That all changed in the year 70, when most of the reigning family was exterminated under mysterious circumstances, and the few who remained were forced to join Ankist to avoid chaos. Your people are convinced it was all caused by a treasonous Ankistan plot, in order to push you into accepting annexation. Even though nothing of this was ever proven, your people never stopped being suspicious of the royal family of Lybra: you secretly hate them. You always try to blame your problems on Lybra, complaining about everything. You pretend your lands are poor, even if there is a rich trade in lumber down river, essential for the construction of the ships and buildings of the kingdom. You complain about northern raiders, even though you only have a small border to defend, while the rest is covered by forest. Your family thinks that you get treated differently from the other nobles, and you've been feeling persecuted for generations. You would like the royal family of Ankist to pay for the alleged wrongs that were done to your mark from the very day that you were annexed into the kingdom.
