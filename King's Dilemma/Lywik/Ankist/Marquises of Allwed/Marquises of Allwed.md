"Life is to be enjoyed"
Known in ancient times as the kingdom of the Keys, the territory now called the Mark of Allwed repeatedly had friction with the equally small but more combative kingdom of Cidlada to the south. In fear of an increasingly probable invasion from south (or so they thought), your ancestors decided to join the kingdom of Ankist in the year 73, crushing any ambition for conquest Cidlada may have had. Since then, your army has done nothing more than look at a border that has not been crossed for generations. Despite the relative poverty of your land, you enjoy life, good food, and your excellent wine, but your alleged mediocrity and laziness are the subject of frequent jokes and derision from the rest of the kingdom. This has earned your people the reputation of always choosing the easiest path and seeking shortcuts, and since your family hardly takes into account all eventualities, you never do anything to prepare your territory for adversity. You often ask for money from the central government to protect the kingdom from "the imminent Cidladian invasion" or other phantom menaces that never materialize. You would prefer that our kingdom had less social inequality.
