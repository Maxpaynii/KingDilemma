The Kingdom of [[Ankist]]  

[[Ankist]] is one of the largest states in [[Lywik]], but it’s not the only one. Ankist itself is the result of the union of many formerly independent kingdoms, conquered in wars or united by diplomacy, that were incorporated over the centuries as Duchies or Marks. The north and the south of Ankist have uncertain borders: the unclaimed borderlands are full of raiders, cutthroats, and dangerous nomadic tribes. The structure of the kingdom is feudal. The Duchies and the Marks are managed by their ruling Houses, represented by the players; these families are all loyal to the king of Ankist, but also have counts and barons that are loyal to them. The Houses are responsible for rallying the army, gathering taxes, and generally administering their territory in the name of the King. The King is personally assisted by the Chamberlain, who will deal with the Council about several general matters. The Council can also rely on the Royal Treasurer, who is charged with monitoring the finances and dealing with the economy of the kingdom. Ankist has a complex and vibrant society, divided into five main social classes:  
-The [[Merchants]]: They are entrepreneurs who run commercial activities and finance trading expeditions. They generally have a large income or fortune that they can rely on. To pursue their commercial interests, the merchants of [[Ankist]] unite themselves into local guilds. They don’t usually behave as a united faction, because the various guilds may have diverging interests, but they periodically elect a [[Guild Master]] or Mistress, who is considered neutral by all the guilds and speaks to the Council for all of them.

-The [[Scholars]]: The brightest minds of the kingdom are usually encouraged to join a university, where they can spend their lives looking for new knowledge and discussing the most important theories. They don’t have a real hierarchy, except the one given by their reputation and the funds that they manage to collect from the rich and the nobles to pursue their studies. However, they do have a sort of “leader” in the figure of the Rector, a life-lasting honorific position given to the most eminent scholar of their time through election, tasked with bringing cultural issues to the attention of the Council. The [[Rector]] also appoints the Librarian Chancellor, who assists the Council in making decisions regarding all scholarly matters and also acts as “court physician.”

-The [[Army]]: Recruited by the Dukes and Marquises but under the direct orders of the Council, the army keeps peace and order in the kingdom. The Council’s strategic orders are executed by two generals: the [[High Commander]], who reports directly to the Council about external threats and commands the army during wars, and the [[Royal Marshal]], who leads the [[King’s Guard]] and intervenes in case of riots or other internal troubles. Only a minority of the soldiers are regulars: most of them are conscripts, men and women called to serve in times of need that go back to their homes in times of peace.

-The [[Common People]]: With their numbers and resiliency, they are the backbone of the kingdom. They mostly have humble jobs like farming, woodcutting, tailoring, or mining. They do not own any significant wealth and the fruits of their work serve them just to get by. Their interests are defended by the [[Tribune]], an elected figure with a mandate of ten years who reports the problems of the common people to the Council
