"Tranquility in Death"
What is known today as the Mark of Crann was once at the heart of the ancient Sabbiyan League when it was at the height of its power. Over the following centuries, it fell into disgrace and became a poor country, but that all changed after you joined the kingdom of Ankist in the year 120. Your family was then able to invest in oil mills and vineyards, reversing the fortunes of your people. The wine produced in your lands is famous for being the strongest in the kingdom. Also known as the "drunken skull," Crann has a dreadful reputation for bloodlust: the neighboring kingdom of Cidlada often complains about the constant looting allegedly performed by Crannards. Even though your family dismisses these as attacks by the brigands of the southern steppes, the raids are actually carried out by your troops, disguised as raiders, who often rob the merchants of that small, poor kingdom and torment their people. Even the nomadic raider tribes of the desert do not dare to approach your borders for fear of your sinister reputation. People from the other duchies and marks of Ankist think Crann is a den of cutthroats, and publicly disapprove of the raids, but they are secretly grateful for your existence because you defend the security of the southern border. However, they hope you never run out of external enemies to satisfy your appetite for violence.
