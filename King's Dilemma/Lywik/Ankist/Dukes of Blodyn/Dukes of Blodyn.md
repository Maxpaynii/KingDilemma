"Harmony is acceptance"
Blodyn used to be part of the kingdom of [[Mhuir]], but your territories passed under the rule of Lybra in the year 143, after Mhuir lost its war against the kingdom of Ankist. You offered no resistance to this change: you are not great warriors and you prefer to obey the laws of someone else rather than face war. It is easy to understand why: your lands overlook the Gulf of Isorropia, your climate is mild, and you have abundant crops and flourishing businesses. Your people are rather hospitable and open, since basically nothing ever happens in your Duchy. Foreigners are welcomed with curiosity rather than suspicion. Flur, your capital city, has a large square and numerous paved streets, all vestiges of the ancient Sabbiyan League, while a large lighthouse has been adapted on the ruins of a building dating from the Salaan Union on Cape Deas. The abundance of time and resources available to your people allows them a very marked spirituality, and a literacy rate higher than the average in the rest of kingdom. Your family often acts as a patron for the best artists, philosophers, and scientists. You are convinced that harmony can be achieved through the union of well-being, religion, and science.
