"Ignorance is bliss"
Partly because of the proximity of the important monastery of Lorrain, your people are extremely devoted to the Cult of the Mother, to the limits of fanaticism. You have a particularly conservative and fundamentalist way of seeing religion. Your family occasionally encourages this tendency by tacitly approving or even fostering witch hunts or persecutions of alleged heretics, to satisfy the ecstatic fervor of the Natarians. You have a deep-rooted intolerance for any reference to foreign religions or ancient cults: you think that the world before the advent of the Mother was impure and bestial, and any kind of information dating back to those times is dangerous, no matter what. Ironically, your duchy is full of traces left behind by ancient civilizations. The Clover Massif hides many ruins of the bygone Sabbiyan League and some even older buildings said to belong to the era of the First King Ommad are scattered all over your territory. The frequent earthquakes that afflict the duchy occasionally reveal forgotten dungeons full of ancient and disturbing knowledge that your family sistematically orders hidden or destroyed, claiming that it could lead anyone deciphering it to madness and heresy.
