"Forests grow strong"
Together with Aontas, the Duchy of Coden constituted the original nucleus of the kingdom of Ankist. The border between the two, the Irmak River, and the fact that Coden was Aontas' natural outlet to the sea, led in distant times to trade and mutual support that quickly resulted in a strong alliance and eventually to unification: the ancient King of the Tree, your ancestor, had no sons. When his daughter married the son of the King of Aontas, their heir inherited both kingdoms, and the first seed of the kingdom of Ankist was born. Because of this, your family has a privileged relationship with the royal family: when you joined, you did so as equals, and formally, you are not vassals of the Crown. The unification between Aontas and Coden led the newborn kingdom of Ankist to become a hegemon over all the small neighboring kingdoms of the time, You have always relied on the royal family of Aontas for your protection, preferring to invest in trade and agriculture instead of weapons and armies, a strategy that has proven successful: sitting right between fertile lands and the prosperous sea of Cheile, your people rarely suffer from famine and your family is one of the richest in the kingdom. You have a reputation for being hospitable and friendly, but also decadent and unmotivated.
