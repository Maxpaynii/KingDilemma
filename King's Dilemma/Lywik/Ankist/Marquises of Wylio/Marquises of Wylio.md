"Never break a deal"
Not a single drop of blood was shed when the rich Mark of Wylio was annexed by Ankist in the year 130. Your ancestors submitted to the King of the Balance and gave up their title of king to become Marquises in exchange for a profitable tax deal. Your people are skilled merchants, and you don't rely on the central government to solve your problems. From the outside, you are considered a bit arrogant: you think you are the only people who produce wealth in the entire kingdom. The commercial vocation of your people makes yours the region of the kingdom that has the most relationships with foreign countries. To provoke the other Duchies, your people say that you should secede from Ankist and join the republic of Kauppias in a confederation, just to see how the rest of the kingdom does without your taxes. You are tireless, especially when you have gold to accumulate, a resource that your family loves above all else. You have made a lot of profitable investments, and you always gain a lot of money. The only investments you ever made that didn't have any return were those funding the endeavors of alchemists and con-artists who claimed to be able to transform lead, or any other substance, into gold.
