"No blood is like our blood"
Originally, the current Mark of Tiryll was part of the kingdom of [[Mhuir]], but when the king of Mhuir sought to share and redistribute the riches of Tiryllian nobles with the rest of the kingdom, your ancestors rebelled. How dare he try to change what has always been? The nobles convinced the lower social classe that the next step would have been to take children away from their mothers and redistribute them to strangers, and in a few months a revolt inflamed Tiryll. The kingdom of Ankist supported the revolt of the nobles, and after a bloody war, in the year 143, Tiryll was annexed to Ankist and your family obtained the title of Marquis. Tiryll has a long shoreline along the Siar Ocean, but it is almost uninhabited: it is covered with forests and plagued by stormy weather. Your people are terrified of the ocean and prefer to sail on the mild and tranquil Gulf of Isorropia or the wide and placid Abne River. You are traditionally very conservative, and you have every interest in keeping the poor as miserable and ignorant as possible, making sure that they are easily recognizable and that they do not mix with your pure, noble lineage.
