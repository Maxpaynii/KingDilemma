"Nothing is as it appears"
Your family was the last to surrender during the war between Ankist and Mhuir in the year 143, but in order to keep your extremely loyal people from rebelling, you received a royal pardon, and when control of your territory was moved from [[Mhuir]] to Ankist, you were assigned the title Duke of Solad. You are dreamers and visionaries, and your engineers build the best ships of the kingdom. Your people have always had their eye on the immensity of the ocean. Your sailors and carpenters are very sought after even on the eastern coast of the kingdom, and it is said that a ship built in your shipyards can withstand even the worst storms unscathed. The libraries of the kingdom are full of scholars from your Duchy. Your merchants are always ready to embark on long journeys, almost more for the sake of exploration than for profit. Yours is a family of poets and navigators more than nobles. You're often depressed, but you're convinced it's in the darkest moments that the most profound ideas and the greatest works are born. Throughout the history of the Duchy, you never stopped asking yourselves what lies beyond what is apparent, and you strive to leave your mark on history and unveil the true essence of reality. Roinn, your capital city, contains the best-preserved vestiges of the Salaan Union in the entire kingdom. There are also many ancient ruins of the Sabbyian League.
